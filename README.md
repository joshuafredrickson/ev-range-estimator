Estimate your EV's actual range based on miles driven and kwh usage. Works offline (and anywhere) when installed as a PWA.

Thanks to GvilleGuy for the [inspiration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IovK4pfPunc).

## Installing as a PWA

You can use the estimator without internet access when you install it as a web app. Read [Installing and uninstalling web apps](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Installing#the_install_user_experience) for instructions on how to install the app on your device.
